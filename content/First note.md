Let's try Obsidian publish with Quartz!
- [x] Once I finish writing this
- [ ] I need to figure out how to publish

```python3
print('hello world, I'm a 1337 coder =P')
```
### 13:36
Let's try this again! Last publish seemed to have failed with the following message:
```xml
<rssÂ version="2.0">
<channel>
<title>ðŸª´ Quartz 4.0</title>
<link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz</link>
<description>Last 10 notes on ðŸª´ Quartz 4.0</description>
<generator>Quartz -- quartz.jzhao.xyz</generator>
</channel>
</rss>
```
If this succeeds, the site should be available at: https://mingdom.github.io/mingdom-capital/

### 13:48
Test again!

### 14:44
Finally got it to work. Needed an index.md file, which was mentioned in the first paragraph of [Quartz: Authoring Content](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/authoring-content).

Next up...
- [ ] Styling it with https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/configuration#general-configuration
